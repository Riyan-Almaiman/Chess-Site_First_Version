# Chess-Site
Using my console chess app to make a website using blazor

My attempt at reusing the logic I wrote in my console chess app to write a web app. The code is really messy I'm learning as I go, but somehow it works

I need to work on CSS/HTML the board doesn't look right unless it's in mobile dimensions (result of me looking up existing css code for boards) and a bunch more things
but the concept works well so far
